  \maketitle

My approach to teaching is shapred by my over 20 years in industry as a researcher, programmer, and software architect.  As I frequently remind my students, computer science is a branch of mathematics, but computer programming is an art, a craft, and a trade.  Thus my goal in any class I teach is to focus on practical applications over abstract theory while weaving in non-technical experiences that prepare the students for life in industry.
